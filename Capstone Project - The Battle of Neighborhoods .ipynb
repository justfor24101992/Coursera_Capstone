The contractor has not yet decided on the neighborhood where he is going to open the restaurant. He has approached a data scientist to provide him some guidence based on the current trends in the available data and enable him to decide on the neighborhood for his restaurant with valid justification. Additionally, the contractor is also interested in knowing the cuisine that would attract the most customers in that area. As a data scientist, I would be using the Foursquare location data and other available datasets to analyse the current trends using graphs and other data visualization methods and create clusters to indicate similar neighborhoods eventually narrowing down on the neighborhood best suited for the restaurant.  \n"

This dataset is an open dataset found in Kaggle. For this project purpose, this dataset would be considered as the data collected from the various people in Paris. This dataset would contain details on their occupations, their food preferences and their willingness to eat at a restaurant. In cases where they are eating outside, their comfort foods which they would look out for are also recorded in this dataset. Based on these information, it would be possible to obtain an insight on the need of the customers and neighborhood which is in most need of a restaurant.\n\nIn the following cells an brief insight into this Food_coded dataset is provided :\n"

Hence we could make the restaurant more appealing to these customers during the intial stage.\n\nThe above information would allow us to choose a speciality cuisine as well for the restaurant, provide us the pricing expectations.\n\nOnce we have the above information sorted out, we would be able to target the neighborhoods having higher percentage of these target customer using the venues in that we can retrive using the FourSquare API.\n\nThis would be my approach towards this problem.\n\n\n"
